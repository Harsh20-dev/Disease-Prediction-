# Disease-Prediction
AI-based system that analyzes user-entered symptoms and generates possible disease insights using natural language processing.

🧠 Disease Prediction System

This project is an AI-based application designed to analyze symptoms provided by users in text form and generate possible disease insights along with general precautionary guidance.

The main focus of this project is to explore how modern AI models can work with natural language inputs and convert unstructured symptom descriptions into meaningful and structured responses. This project is created as a learning and experimentation initiative and demonstrates the practical use of AI in healthcare awareness scenarios.

🚀 How It Works

The user enters symptoms in simple text form

The AI model processes the input using natural language understanding

Based on the input, the system generates possible disease insights

General precautions are suggested for awareness purposes

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – core implementation and data handling

Hugging Face Transformers – working with pre-trained language models

LLaMA-based Language Model – for text understanding and response generation

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand how AI language models can be applied to real-world problems and how they can generate useful responses from text-based inputs. The emphasis is on learning, experimentation, and responsible AI usage rather than medical accuracy.
